# ESPN-Web-Scrapping
This portfolio project involved collecting data from ESPN CRIC INFO by web scraping using R using rvest package. The data set was then cleaned using MYSQL and visulaized on Tableau.
The analysis focused on the past three winners of the Cricket World Cup, examining the total number of matches played by the teams and their win rates compared to other teams. 
The analysis was conducted year by year for each World Cup. Due to upcoming matches, the data for the next World Cup is still being processed.
